# How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Service workers help to aid in graceful degradation which is the goal of having a system continue to work even after a large portion of it does not. This could be because some parts of it are outdated or some functionalities are not available for certain platforms. Service workers help to achieve this continued functionality by caching resources to  enable users to have offline functionality. Offline functionality is one piece of graceful degradation on top of making sure that minimum functionality still runs without other basic resources such as javascript. This shows the importance of how important service workers are when it comes to continued functionality without a network.
